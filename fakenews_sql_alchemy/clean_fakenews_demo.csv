carefully suggests something interesting nature social conservatism liberals may easy conclude opposition things like samesex marriage immigration diversity rooted bigotry groups manifestation specific homophobia xenophobia islamophobia results voxmorning consult poll along prior research authoritarianism suggests might something else going particular reason parenting goals coincide animus specific groups werent asking questions whether important children respect people different races whether respect authority rules generally coincide heavily might look surface like bigotry really much closer stenners theory activation likely hetherington suggested authoritarians much susceptible messages tell fear specific whether preexisting animus group fears would therefore change time events made different groups seem less threatening depends said whether particular group people made outgroup whether identified dangerous since september media outlets politicians painted muslims dangerous

susceptible messages ways outsiders social changes threaten america lash groups identified objects concern given moment thats say attitude way better simple racism xenophobia still dangerous damaging especially empowers frightening demagogues like donald trump perhaps point helps explain trumps supporters come quickly embrace extreme policies targeting outgroups mass deportation millions people

year example true support international trade agreements issues associated mainstream gop economic policies groups opposed tax cuts support trade agreements evenly lukewarm across degrees authoritarianism real divide issues one factor data couldnt capture nevertheless important trumps style trumps specific policies arent thing sets apart rest field gop candidates rather rhetoric style
