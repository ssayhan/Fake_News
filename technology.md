# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
-We cleaned our dataset using pandas library
-We created visualizations using matplotlib
## More complex Data Cleaning
-We imported regex to filter words
-We imported word_tokenizer from nltk.tokenize 
-We also downloaded ‘punkt’ and ‘stopwords’ from nltk for a more complex analysis

## Database Storage
-We will store out database on PgAdmin using PostgreSQL

## Machine Learning
-NLP machine learning
-We’ll also use Pyspark’s BinaryClassificationEvaluator

## Dashboard
-We plan on creating a visual story board with our analysis results using Tableau
-We also would like to create a Flake template that intakes keywords from news articles and can predict whether they’re likely to be true or false.
