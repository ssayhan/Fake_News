With the advent of the internet, and more importantly social media, fake news and missinformation has been on the rise and has been plaguing our society.  Some is so well hidden and advertised, it may be dfficult to spot if a source is fake news or not.  The purpose of this project is to create a Machine Learning model to detect fake news and missinformation.  We will be using Natural Language processing and Bianary Classification Evaluators on our dataset to help with training and testing of the Model.

# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python and Machine Learning algorithms.

## Database Storage
SQL is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask to display the data.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is Natural Language processing and Bianary Classification Evaluators.
